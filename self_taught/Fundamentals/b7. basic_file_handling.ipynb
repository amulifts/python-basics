    "## Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```code\n",
    "file = open(\"filename\", \"mode\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**filename:** Name of the file you want to open. <br>\n",
    "**mode:** Mode in which you want to open the file (e.g., 'r' for reading, 'w' for writing, 'a' for appending).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Modes:\n",
    "- 'r': Read (default mode) - Opens the file for reading.\n",
    "- 'w': Write - Opens the file for writing (creates a new file if it doesn't exist or truncates the file if it does).\n",
    "- 'a': Append - Opens the file for appending (creates a new file if it doesn't exist).\n",
    "- 'r+': Read and Write - Opens the file for both reading and writing."
