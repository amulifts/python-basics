# Python for Everyone

"Python for Everyone" is a repository on programming using the Python language. It serves as a tutorial or guide to the Python language for a beginner audience. If all you know about computers is how to save text files, then this repository is for you.

## Course Summary

Learning to program can be overwhelming. Concepts and facts come at you fast and most courses don't cover many of them at all or at a beginner's pace. **This is not most courses**. Python for absolute beginners is our premier course for beginning developers. We start at the very beginning, teaching you the big ideas and concepts covered in a CS 101 course. Then we move on to writing increasingly complex code and applications in Python.

## Who is this repository for?

This repository is for **anyone who wants to learn Python and computer programming**. If you haven't had a formal education in software development or have tried other courses and programming "didn't stick", then you can start here.

The student requirements are quite light for this course. You'll need:

* Basic typing skills
* Foundational computer experience (installing software etc.) 
* A simple computer (macOS, Windows, or Linux)
* A desire to learn programming

## What games will we build?

I believe it's important to learn programming in the context of something that feels plausible and real. We won't build a bunch of disconnected loops and other programming examples that don't relate back to real programs. We  will build several fun games that cover meaningful content that any elementary 
Python course would cover.
